                        The following Terms and Conditions (“Agreement”) govern your participation, registration, and

                        continued engagement with Hashtap Solutions (“the Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”), an

                        independent online platform providing access to third-party survey participation links,

                        micro-work opportunities, freelance engagements, and similar online earning activities

                        (collectively referred to as “the Services”). By completing registration, submitting payment,

                        accessing, or using our Services, you (“the Subscriber”, “User”, or “Participant”) acknowledge

                        that you have read, understood, and agreed to be legally bound by this Agreement in its

                        entirety, without limitation or qualification.The Company functions primarily as a digital

                        intermediary that curates and disseminates links, invitations, or application references to

                        online tasks, projects, surveys, and employment opportunities made available by various

                        unaffiliated external entities (“Third-Party Companies” or “External Providers”). The Company

                        neither creates, manages, verifies, nor guarantees the authenticity, duration, compensation,

                        suitability, or availability of such opportunities and holds no direct employment, partnership,

                        or agency relationship with said External Providers.Upon successful registration and

                        verification of payment of the designated activation or subscription fee, Subscribers shall

                        receive, via the Company’s platform, email, or other approved electronic communication channels,

                        a series of links, forms, or task references representing invitations to apply for online jobs,

                        surveys, or micro assignments. It is expressly understood that such provision of access shall

                        not be construed as an employment offer, nor as an assurance of any remuneration, outcome, or

                        benefit from the Third-Party Companies to which such links redirect.The Subscriber acknowledges

                        and agrees that the Company’s role is limited exclusively to information aggregation and digital

                        facilitation, and that any engagement between the Subscriber and a Third-Party Company occurs

                        entirely at the discretion and under the independent terms of said Third-Party Company. The

                        Company is not responsible for, nor does it control, the nature, qualifications, requirements,

                        deadlines, or acceptance criteria of the opportunities made available through such links.

                        Accordingly, the Company bears no liability whatsoever should a Subscriber fail to meet the

                        eligibility or competency standards required by any Third-Party Company, fail to submit an

                        application properly, or fail to complete any process associated with such opportunities.The

                        Subscriber further acknowledges that job descriptions, surveys, or work assignments accessible

                        via the provided links may vary significantly in scope, complexity, and reward structure. The

                        Company disclaims all responsibility for the accuracy, validity, or timeliness of any such

                        content. The Subscriber assumes full responsibility for evaluating the appropriateness,

                        legitimacy, and compatibility of each opportunity with their own professional, academic, and

                        technical qualifications prior to engaging with any Third-Party Company or submitting any

                        information thereto.All payments made to the Company for registration, activation, or continued

                        access to the platform are deemed final, non-refundable, and non-transferable, except in

                        circumstances where the Company, at its sole discretion, determines that a refund is warranted

                        due to verifiable technical or administrative error directly attributable to the Company. The

                        payment of such fees does not constitute a purchase of employment, a guarantee of job placement,

                        or a promise of income of any nature. The Subscriber understands that the activation fee serves

                        solely as access facilitation to the online platform and not as remuneration toward any

                        employment or direct project assignment.The Subscriber agrees to provide accurate, complete, and

                        current registration details and to maintain the security of their account credentials at all

                        times. The Company shall not be held responsible for unauthorized access, misuse, or loss of

                        access credentials. Any misrepresentation, fraudulent activity, or use of the platform in

                        violation of applicable laws or this Agreement may result in the suspension or termination of

                        the Subscriber’s account without notice or compensation.The Company expressly disclaims all

                        warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of

                        merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The Services are

                        provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, and the Company does not guarantee

                        uninterrupted access, accuracy, or completeness of the information distributed through its

                        systems. The Subscriber accepts all risks associated with using or relying upon such information

                        and agrees to hold the Company harmless from any loss, damage, delay, disappointment, or

                        dissatisfaction arising therefrom.The Company shall not, under any circumstances, be liable for

                        indirect, incidental, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages, including but not limited

                        to loss of opportunity, reputation, data, or expected earnings, arising from or related to the

                        use or inability to use the Services, even if the Company has been advised of the possibility of

                        such damages. The total aggregate liability of the Company to any Subscriber shall in no event

                        exceed the amount of the activation fee actually paid by said Subscriber.The Subscriber

                        acknowledges that participation in online surveys, remote jobs, or freelance activities

                        inherently involves third-party systems, websites, and digital communications, which may be

                        subject to separate privacy policies, user terms, or data-handling procedures. The Company is

                        not responsible for the content, data collection, or operational integrity of such third-party

                        systems and advises Subscribers to review all applicable external terms before engaging in any

                        activity beyond the Company’s official platform.The Company reserves the unconditional right to

                        modify, revise, or terminate access to any portion of its Services without prior notice. Changes

                        to these Terms and Conditions may occur periodically and shall take effect immediately upon

                        publication. Continued use of the Services after such modifications constitutes acknowledgment

                        and acceptance of the revised terms.This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between

                        the Subscriber and the Company and supersedes all prior representations, communications, or

                        agreements, whether oral or written, concerning the subject matter herein. If any provision of

                        this Agreement is deemed invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, such provision shall be

                        severed to the minimum extent necessary without affecting the validity of the remaining

                        provisions.
